        This group of Snescals is busy gathering shells from the shoreline. Their species had evolved to become reliant on seashells, after their predecessors on year one Comet began to use them as backpacks for a means of transporting goods. The shells have become one with their anatomy since then and are necessary for their survival. They will sell the smaller scraps in Surpet's marketplace.
