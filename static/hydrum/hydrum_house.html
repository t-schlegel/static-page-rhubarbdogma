        This is a hydrosphere, or rather, the corpse of one. The Dandites of Hydrum dig up these plants, move them to soil where they cannot continue to grow, and secure them with stakes. Though the Dandites gut the interior of the plant, the hydrospheres are kept in a functioning state by the fronds (the structure on the left) that Dandites attach to their exterior.  These fronds are part synthetic, part biological creations engineered by the Dandites themselves that send essential signals to maintain the hydrosphere's basic functions as it becomes their dwelling. Let's look inside to discover why the Dandites preserve these hydrospheres in this state.
