        Beneath every neighborhood of hydrospheres lies a vast sewer network. Dandites produce 10 tons of sludge waste per day, all of which flows through their drains. Thousands of goblins have lived underground since year one on Cometâ€”the sewage system was built directly alongside their homes without their consent. As a compromise, the Dandites have employed these underground dwellers to manage the network and drain the tanks.
