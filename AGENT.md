## Architecture Overview

- Interactive map-based navigation for the "Year Two Comet" world
- Archive section with sketchbook galleries
- Sketch dump gallery
- Multiple themed areas (Cluton, Hydrum, Sepine, Surpet, Vespilk)

## Build Process

The site uses a hybrid approach:
- **Static pages**: Most pages are hand-written HTML files in the `static/` directory
- **Generated pages**: Archive sketchbooks and sketchdump pages are generated by `generate_pages.py`
- **Taskfile.yaml**: Task automation for build and deployment

### Generated Content

Run `python3 generate_pages.py` to regenerate:
- `static/archive/sb1.html` - `static/archive/sb5.html` (sketchbook galleries)
- `static/sketchdump.html` (sketch dump gallery)

These pages are auto-generated from image files in their respective directories.

Existing JS modules:
- `js/modal.js` - Image modal functionality for galleries
- `js/card3d.js` - 3D card effects
- `js/scrollbar.js` - Custom scrollbar styling
- `script.js` - map.html page interactions


## Navigation Structure

The site has a consistent navbar across all pages:
```html
<header>
    <a href="/" class="font-times text-xl hover:underline absolute top-0 left-0 m-4 z-10">rhubarb dogma</a>
    <nav class="absolute top-0 right-0 m-4 z-10">
        <!-- Navigation items can be added here -->
    </nav>
</header>
```

## Development Notes

Dynamic content generation is now handled by `generate_pages.py`
Image galleries use modal.js for lightbox functionality
World map areas use HTML image maps for navigation

Styling is done in style.css

Avoid writing inline styles and never edit style.css directly as it is minified and autogenerated by tailwind.

When JS is needed, don't inline it with <script> tags but rather place the JS in the appropriate .js file that gets linked in to the html page that requires it (if there isn't a preexisting JS file already linked in, it's okay to create a new .js file with a descriptive name and link it in).
