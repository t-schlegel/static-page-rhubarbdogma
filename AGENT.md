This directory ("src") is the root of our static webpage.

Styling is done in style.css

Don't write inline styles.

When JS is needed, don't inline it with <script> tags but rather place the JS in the appropriate .js file that gets linked in to the html page that requires it (if there isn't a preexisting JS file already linked in, it's okay to create a new .js file with a descriptive name and link it in).
