We are working on our website rhubarbdogma.com

We are gearing up to do a big refactor.
The root of the static website is the "./static" directory.

We also have "./src" which contains the code for the previous version of the website, which was written as a FastHTML app.

What we want to do is turn the code in src into static code that can live in "./static" instead which will then be hosted by github pages along with the rest of the pages already in "./static".

What we need to do:

- [x] Examine the codebase in src to understand it.
- [x] Create static/index.html based on src/pages/index.py
- [x] Move the static files that were previously served by the FastHTML app in src/public/ over to static/ with the appropriate directory structure
- [x] Carefully migrate any css code and tailwind configuration from src/ over to static/ (note the webapp in src auto-generated app.css but in our static page our stylesheet is now called style.css)
- [x] Carefully consider the parts of the FastHtml app that were autogenerated based on the contents of the folders (for example the archive, sketchbooks, and sketchdump) and write Python code to generate these during the build step for our static page
- [ ] Manually inspect all the pages and correcy any bugs/issues
