        High in the caves of Sepine live lizard nomads. Looks like these guys have a stolen Dandite egg, which is all too common in Comet's black market. In fact, these lizards are the biggest perpetrators of egg theft. They will exchange the eggs for large quantities of Aerolite - a rare and precious mineral that they then build weaponry and other forms of technology with. No one is quite sure who they make these exchanges with, or how the other party obtains the Aerolite.
