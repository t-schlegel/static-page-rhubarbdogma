        Here is the inside of a typical hydrosphere. The natural humidity perfectly accommodates the Dandites with their thin, sensitive skin that requires constant moisturization. Without it, they would almost instantly shrivel up and die. These hideous creatures must wear suits when venturing outside, which fortunately conceals their outright offensive appearance while trapping sludge against their skin. The sludge acts as a moisture barrier, much like lotion. You can spot it here in large piles on the floor. 

        The warm, humid interior environment serves a dual purpose: ideal for incubating the Dandites' eggs—a precious resource on Comet—while the hydrosphere walls themselves secrete the vital sludge crucial for Dandite survival.
